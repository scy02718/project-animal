## PROJECT ANIMAL

**Complete working pipeline of dataset preprocessing and inference of animal classification**<br>
Chan (Samuel) Yoo<br>

Description: *Using a pretrained Resnet34 model using Pytorch lightning, created a working pipeline for the inference and data preprocessing of animal dataset from Kaggle. Main achievement
from the project is that I have practiced using the local GPU of the computer, not on google colaboratory. Also I practiced using multiple featues of deep learning by implementing them, such as early stopping and fine tuning different hyperparameters*
